            <h1>Guess Where I am!</h1>
            <p>I am a Latin American Country with population of 11,221,060. I am 109,884 km2 big<br>
              Before the arrival of the Spanish, <br>
              I was inhabited by three distinct tribes of indigenous peoples of the Americas.<br>
              The Taíno (an Arawak people), the Guanahatabey and the Ciboney people.<br>
              The ancestors of the Ciboney migrated from the mainland of South America,<br>
              with the earliest sites dated to 5,000 BP.<br>
              The Taíno arrived from Hispanola sometime in the 3rd century A.D.<br>
              When Columbus arrived they were the dominant culture here,<br>
              having an estimated population of 150,000.<br>
              The Taíno were farmers, while the Ciboney were farmers as well as fishers and hunter-gatherers.</p>
